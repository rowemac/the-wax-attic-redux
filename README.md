# the wax attic.

## Description

The Wax Attic Single Page Application (SPA) serves as fully interactive library for vinyl album lovers who wish to monitor their collection records all in one place. The client is able to create new album instances, edit current instances, or even delete instances entirely. This full CRUD funcitonality is made possible with the use of seamless, user-friendly controlled forms. Finally, if a user wishes to find an album fast, a search bar at the top of the page will help them sort albums by either album title or artist name.
